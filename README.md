# OnlyKey App

This is an unofficial attempt to make an ARM compatible app for **OnlyKey** 
You likely want the official OnlyKey-App from here: https://github.com/trustcrypto/OnlyKey-App
I'm not a professional programmer, just an enthusiast that wants to set up my OnlyKey without buying a non ARM computer to do so.
I would advise to only use this fork with caution.

OnlyKey can be purchased here: [OnlyKey order](http://www.crp.to/p/)

## Geting Started

Just getting started with OnlyKey?

## About

**OnlyKey App** is an app to be used along with an OnlyKey device. The app is used for things like:

- Initial setup of OnlyKey (Setup)
- Configuration of accounts (Slots)
- Loading keys for PGP, SSH, and secure backup (Keys)
- Backup and restore of OnlyKey (Backup/Restore)
- Setting OnlyKey preferences (Preferences)
- Setting advanced options such as Yubikey and U2F security info (Advanced)

*The app is required on all systems where Google Authenticator (TOTP) is used*

For information on using the app see the [OnlyKey User's Guide](https://docs.crp.to/usersguide.html)

## Installation

To use the **standalone app:**

- Obtain an installer from https://github.com/trustcrypto/OnlyKey-Chrome-App/releases/latest
- Install and launch the app.

Linux users installing the deb package should verify the GPG signature using `debsig-verify`. There is an article outlining this process [here](https://www.unboundsecurity.com/docs/UKC/UKC_Code_Signing_IG/HTML/Content/Products/UKC-EKM/UKC_Code_Signing_IG/LinuxPackage/SignDebian.html#h3_4).

To use the **OnlyKey Chrome App:** (Chromebook Users)

- Go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/onlykey-configuration/adafilbceehejjehoccladhbkgbjmica,
  click the **ADD TO CHROME** button.
- Once the app installs ensure that your Chrome Bookmarks Bar is visible by
  going to Bookmarks -> Show Bookmarks bar.
- Select "Apps" icon in the bookmarks bar and select **OnlyKey Configuration**.

## Developer Notes

This repository contains shared code that can be used to build multiple types of
apps.

To run this code as a Chrome app:

    $ npm run chrome

To run as NWJS app:

    $ npm start

To create releases:

    $ npm run release

This will create an installer in the `releases/` subfolder. The installer is created for the current OS; this means you will need to run the `release` command on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS to generate all the installers.

On Windows, you need to install [NSIS][nsis] first, and ensure that it's present in your shell's `%PATH%`. That is, add `C:/Program Files (x86)/NSIS` or similar to your `%PATH%` in the operating system settings. On Mac OS, you need to install an optional NPM dependecy: `npm install appdmg`.

To run tests:

    $ npm test

Running tests requires the SDK version of NWJS, which comes with a `chromedriver` that handles automated Selenium tests. To install that version, run `npm install nw --nwjs_build_type=sdk`. Note that to create releases, you should install the non-sdk variant again; otherwise the installer will be unnecessarily large.
